Welcome to Drone Dynamics, a multiplayer drone simulator. In this game, you can build and spec your own drones and compete against other real players in a Battle Royale tournament inspired by Fall Guys, or practice flying in a playground.

## Gameplay
There are 2 main modes: **Playground** and **Battle Royale**. Each modes can be played from as a part of up to 4 people.

### Playground mode
In Playground Mode you can practice flying around a selected map. Within the game, you can open the build mode to spec your drone on the 'fly'. The drone can be customised from the number of motors, the motor positions. As well as tuning the various parameters on each individual motor and the Motor Controller.

### Battle Royale mode
In Battle Royale mode, there are different types of levels, each with a unique objective. These levels include:

* Race through the checkpoints
* Land on the targets in the quickest time possible
* Maintain an average height of x meters
* Highest score in tricks competition
* Get through the hole at the fastest speed
* Film a moving object with a camera attached to the drone with the best cinematics

To win the tournament, you must complete all the levels and earn the most points. Can you outfly your opponents and become the champion?
